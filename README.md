# FundFood
FundFood is a simple marketplace app that allows users to transact their unwanted/expired food. Users can sell their unwanted food at a lower price or even for free! We aim to reduce both food wastage in Singapore and food shortage in underprivileged countries. 

To start, users can input their unwanted food into a form, which will then be logged onto the marketplace for everybody to see. Users can scroll to the marketplace to see whether they see another unused food in which they are interested in (to eat or to recycle) and can contact the user directly to manage the transaction.

On top of that, we will have a logging system to log the amount of food waste saved. Profits from the government's funding and the webpage service will be donated to underprivileged families with food shortages.

Users can trade unused food by posting it onto the trading site
